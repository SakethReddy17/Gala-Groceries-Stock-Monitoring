# AI VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP BY FORAGE

As part of this virtual internship, I worked as a Data Science team member at Cognizant. 

My goal is to develop an ML solution to improve the sales of Gala Groceries (located in USA) in a crisis situation.

For deploying the project, you can use Google Colab to open the Cognizant file and download the dataset from Forage.
